# heltic_arduino_wifi_Device_AP_Detector_LCD
An enhanced version of Ray Burnette's Arduini wifi device/ap detector which now includes disconnected device broadcasts, and Heltec LCD display

The original program by Ray Burnette only displayed AP's and connected devices.  I ahve added code to detect and display (in the LCD) and disconnected devices.
